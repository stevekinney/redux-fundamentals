The slice creates action creators based on the name of keys in the reducer. Let's dispatch the action from the slice in `CreateHuman`

```js
dispatch(humansSlice.actions.add(name));
```

That's it. No need to import a bunch of constants and action creators.

## Exercise

Okay, it's your turnâ€”add it to `CreateTask`.
