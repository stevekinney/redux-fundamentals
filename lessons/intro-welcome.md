## Who Is This For?

(Forthcoming…)

## Code Examples and Project Starters

Clone [this repository][projects] and run `npx recursive-install` to install all of the dependencies.

[projects]: https://github.com/stevekinney/react-and-typescript-projects

## Your Set Up

You don't need a lot to get rocking and/or rolling with this course. In fact, most of the examples and exercises have versions that are hosted on [CodeSandbox][]. So, you probably only need a browsers and if you're reading this, you likely already have one of those.

[codesandbox]: https://codesandbox.io

But, let's assume that you also want to work on some of this stuff locally as well. In that case, you're going to want to have the following installed:

- [NodeJS][]. This course was tested using the latest LTS release of Node at the time (e.g. 14), but it honestly shouldn't matter much. I recommend using [nvm][] to manage which version of Node you're using.
- You're going to need an editor of some kind. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code][vscode]. But, you likely already have opinions on this topic.

## My Set Up

In case you're morbidly curious about what I'm using as we spend the next several hours together, here is a quick rundown of my setup.

- **Font**: [Fira Code][firacode]. It's basically a version of Mozilla's [Fira Mono][firamono], but with fancy ligatures.
- **Theme**: [Tomorrow and Tomorrow Night][tomorrow]. Why? Because I've always used it and I'm very lazy.
- **Plugins**: I don't install a lot of plugins, but here are some of the ones that I like: [Auto Import](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=steoates.autoimport), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

## Who am I?

Hello! My name is [Steve Kinney][steve] and I'm the front-end architect at [Twilio][twilio]—we're the company that sends text messages and emails and whatnot. I help lead all of our front-end and user-interface efforts at the company. Pretty much everything we do is built on top of React and uses TypeScript.

In the past, I started the front-end engineering program at the [Turing School of Software and Design][turing], started a JavaScript conference called [DinosaurJS][dino], and wrote a book on [Electron][electron].

I live in Denver, Colorado. If you are so inclined to find me on the Internet, you may do so at the following locations:
